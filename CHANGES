Changelog for Beam-Wire

1.021     2018-03-18 12:26:40-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed a test failing when file paths have regex metacharacters.
      Thanks @mohawk2!

1.020     2017-05-05 00:21:19-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Objects that compose the Beam::Service role will now get their
      name and the container they came from as attributes to their
      constructor. This allows an object to look up services later if it
      wants to (if, for some reason, those services can't be declared as
      dependencies). [Github #56]
